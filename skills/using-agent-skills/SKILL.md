# Using Agent Skills (Kotlin Multiplatform)

## Overview

This is the meta-skill — it defines *how* agents should work, not *what* they should build. Five core operating behaviors ensure agents produce reliable, high-quality Kotlin Multiplatform code that matches project conventions, compiles for every target, and matches user intent.

## Five Core Operating Behaviors

### 1. Surface Assumptions Explicitly

Before implementing non-trivial work, state your assumptions:

- "I'm assuming this logic belongs in `commonMain` since nothing in it is platform-specific"
- "I'm assuming Android, iOS, desktop, and web are all shipping targets since all are configured in `shared/build.gradle.kts`"
- "I'm assuming offline-first since the project uses Room KMP as source of truth"

**Why:** Unstated assumptions are the #1 cause of wasted agent work. A wrong assumption in step 1 makes steps 2–10 wrong.

### 2. Manage Confusion

When encountering inconsistencies, **stop and clarify**:

- "The spec says use DataStore but the existing code uses platform-specific storage — which should I follow?"
- "TaskRepository has two different patterns — which is the intended one?"
- Name the specific confusion. Don't proceed with a guess.

### 3. Push Back When Warranted

Don't default to agreement. When a request has concrete downsides, say so:

- "Adding that JVM-only dependency to `commonMain` breaks the iOS and web targets — it needs an abstraction or a different library"
- "Skipping tests here is risky because this ViewModel handles payment state on every platform"
- Provide the tradeoff, let the human decide.

### 4. Enforce Simplicity

Before writing code, ask: "Can this be done with less?"

- Resist unnecessary abstractions — including needless `expect`/`actual` pairs where common code or an interface would do
- Don't add features beyond what's requested
- Three similar lines of code is better than a premature abstraction
- Follow project conventions, don't introduce new patterns

### 5. Maintain Scope Discipline

Only modify what's requested:

- Don't refactor neighboring code "while you're here"
- Don't add error handling for impossible scenarios
- Don't add comments to code you didn't change
- Don't upgrade dependencies or platform floors unrelated to the task

## Skills Are Workflows, Not Suggestions

- **Follow steps in order** — each step depends on the previous
- **Never skip verification** — "it looks right" is not evidence
- **Produce tangible artifacts** — specs, task lists, test results, not just prose
- **Anti-rationalizations are real** — if you're about to skip a step, check the "Common Rationalizations" table
- **Assumption-making without validation is the most common failure mode**

## Verification

- [ ] Assumptions stated explicitly before implementation
- [ ] Confusion surfaced (not silently resolved with guesses)
- [ ] Pushback provided when warranted (with tradeoffs)
- [ ] Simplicity enforced (no unnecessary abstractions or needless expect/actual)
- [ ] Scope maintained (only requested changes made)
- [ ] Correct skill loaded for the current task
